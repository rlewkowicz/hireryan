        Liquid Web
    </div>
    <div class="project-description__content">
        <p>
            Before we talk about LiquidWeb, I'd like to touch on my separation. We got bought out by Madison Dearborn
            some time near the end of May. The official response from the State of Michigan reads in part:
        </p>
        <p>
            You were fired from LIQUID WEB INC on November 04, 2015 under the employer's "At-Will" policy.
        The employer failed to provide information regarding your separation.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's the jist of it.
        </p>
        <p>I was recently asked “What is something you liked about LiquidWeb?”. I liked that question because it forced a positive connotation, it wasn’t the traditional “Tell me about where you worked.”. I hate to say it though, I still had to pause. I suppose I never really liked LiquidWeb as an organization. I LOVED the people. Wonderful people. I can’t think of any one I didn’t want to talk to. Certainly there were people I liked less than others, but I never outright didn’t like someone. The breadth of experience was invaluable. We dealt with issues spanning the internet itself. It puts me in a position to just have phenomenal scope on technology as a whole and understand where I want to take my skill set.</p>

        <p>Of course that leaves the follow up question, “What are some issues you had with Liquid Web?”. I know it’s not good to say bad things about a previous employer, but this isn’t going to be a “John Doe” never made coffee diatribe. Liquid Web has some very real structural and organizational issues that made my job very stressful. I’ll touch on the role nuances within their respective categories, for now I’ll talk about the broader perspective. When we got bought out, they surveyed employees and in a spectacular show put all the things we talk about in private on the walls of one of our big meeting rooms. I could talk at length on any of the topics, but the big one was a lack of leadership, and lack of direction. It’s interesting because if you go look at a site like glassdoor and look at the oldest reviews, much of it still rings very true today. Matt’s (our CEO)  best friend was the head of marketing, or sales, or something. Isn’t weird when you have to put “or something” at the end of a job title? I guess they got into a fight and then he still worked for Liquid Web but didn’t do anything. But then he kinda did do something again. Matt gets in a fight with his best friend and suddenly a major department (departments?) doesn’t have a leader. Who really knows though? That’s the crux of it. There was no organizational chart. There was a who is who, but I think it was outdated most of the time. You ask 3 people who does what and you’ll get 4 different answers. You could never push a project, you could never get anything done. The horizontal organization structure didn’t help. 400 people I think and everyone was one rung away from the executives, two if you were in support (support has supervisors). I’m not saying that would be a problem everywhere, but for this company, that was a problem. So me, my boss, executives and I would say CEO after that, but the most I saw Matt in the entire time I worked there was when he was selling the place.</p>

        <p>I feel like you couldn’t take pride in your work or feel good about yourself. You could say the culture was casual, I’d call it toxic. You wear a button down shirt and people ask you where the job interview was at.</p>

        <p>I don’t mean this to be so critical. Liquidweb just wore me down emotionally, and some of this may show through a little bit as I talk about my roles and projects.</p>

        <p>This was my blog about a year in. The last post was November 10, 2013. Turns out, it’s hard to sell yourself as a professional with a title like that. I liked it though. It was meant to be a tongue in cheek commentary on the fact that we all use google to some extent. I wanted to cater to the “Google Administrator”. For a while there I was the first result after percona itself for certain search terms. As well as the IPtables U32 module. My site was up and down though as my interest in it waned. I fell from google searches. Still though, some decent content (provided the site is up)

        <p>KeyBorg was a company I started (and still own) with the intent on building devices to do keyboard input into a computing device. Ryan Lewkowicz, president of myself. Resume job title added. The project spawned because I was doing something in VIM. I used “You complete me” for my C++ code completion and I had to do this same shortcut again and again. I was like I wish I could just kinda twitch to fire the key. Then I started thinking about how useful that would be. Even moving into things like video games or a VR space. </p>

        <p>I ordered my <a href='https://www.arduino.cc/'>Arduino</a>, the <a href='http://www.advancertechnologies.com/p/muscle-sensor-v3.html'>Muscle Sensor v3</a>,  and a textbook called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Third-Edition/dp/0071771336'>Practical Electronics for Inventors</a>. I got everything working, but one of my sensors didn’t work, and the one that did had a lot of noise on it. It just didn’t read as well as I needed it to. I wanted to have it ready for a kickstart, but with it actually working somewhat. You can fake it if you really wanted, I’m not about that though. So shortly after I completed a prototype of this thing, they announced the v4 sensor. I ordered it, and then they took so long to ship it. It was like 4 months later. I got it, but lost my job shortly thereafter and it’s taken a back seat now to building a more pertinent skill for making myself marketable. </p>

        <p>There are some real barriers to launching this thing though. Microsoft holds 2 patents regarding electromyopathy. The first one:
        </p>

        <p><a href='http://www.google.com/patents/US20090327171'>http://www.google.com/patents/US20090327171</a></p>

        <p>This is a valid patent. It defines a device that performs a specific function. The second patent however is not (according to me at least):
        </p>

        <p><a href='http://www.google.com/patents/US8170656'>http://www.google.com/patents/US8170656</a></p>

        <p>You can’t just go claiming everything. This patent says, any device that reads electrical signals and inputs to any computing device. Now I know what you’re thinking. Good luck fighting Microsoft on this patent. That’s the thing though, patent court is pretty level. It was at least, and probably still is. What do I mean by this? So since 1999 upto 2012 patents have been subject to a process called Inter Partes Reexamination. That process had cumulatively narrowed or canceled some 88% of patents. Since 2012 the process is called Inter Partes Review, and I don’t think there’s a whole lot of data on what's transpired so far (at least as far I had looked at the time). The difference is now there is like a little panel of three judges. The problem is, if you challenge a patent in patent court, you’re under an el stoppo or el stoppe or something like that. What it is, is that you can’t make the same argument in a civil court that you made in patent court. I’d like to talk to a lawyer on this, I just haven’t had the time or money. </p>

        <p>So this thing is benched for now, but it was a thing I was doing. </p>

        <p>I wanted to build a skill set and to do that, I needed a project. Anyone can build a website, I wanted to explore the concepts of a modern web. I wanted to make a platform with streaming data that was dynamic that anyone could subscribe to. These dynamic concepts will lay the foundations for a distributed hosting architecture. </p>

        <p>It does work, but there are some structural issues with the application. Nothing terrible, but at this point vs a refactor it just needs to be redone. The system in its modularity is cool, and a lot of the code is going to transfer over, but as whole some things are hacky. For example, I use socket.io for live broadcasting of redis events to a web browser. Socket io will only broadcast channels that it knows to listen for, and channels only exist if they are broadcasting or being listened to. I don’t have a way to just get the channels that are going be broadcast. So when I register lead subscriptions, I use a redis list to store channels. The reason I have to do this is because I broadcast through Laravel's redis facade vs broadcasting via the node socket with socket.io. I can fix that, but given the css issues, and some of the database schema issues, I just want to rebuild it. </p>

        <p>All this stuff started to get a bit sloppy and it stemmed mostly from poor asset management. One CCS sheet with poor naming conventions and scattered js files really started to slow me down. I re-approached this capacity with hireryan.today. Now with all my asset management and naming conventions tightened up, I’m ready to move forward. I think it will be a bit before I revisit the tracker though, it works for what I need it to do. I’m ready to start the push on binary oasis.</p>

        <p>I’m apprehensive to even release my outline. It’s weird to think that I made something proprietary, but I did. This is mine. I think in the age of information, where ideas are so abundant the value of an idea can be overlooked. Regardless of how well it works, just even knowing where to start is kind of a big deal. In any case, below is a project outline. If a company is just dying to see my code, and is not a hosting company, I can share the little API I made. It’s only 200 some odd lines of code, but it’s my functioning 200 some odd lines of code that does what I need. In any case, take a look:</p>

        <p>So during the lead tracking application I started running into issues. My file setup was really disjointed, and my class naming conventions started making it difficult to properly use selectors. I needed to tighten up my organization and design as well as showcase what I’d been working on. </p>
        <p>I’m really happy with it, you have nice clean single page design. The time line is pure CSS which I’m really happy with. These are custom assets. You can’t find this stuff anywhere. The whole site is custom from scratch (as scratch as laravel is). I use stylus for for my CSS pre processor, and a BEM like naming syntax. I tried to go pure BEM, but would deviate occasionally. I would do like Block, element, model, element. The site has some very custom assets that don’t easily prescribe to traditional naming conventions. What I can say is this, I have a very explicit naming convention and you’d never be lost trying to understand an element and its children. I also went 7-1 as defined by Hugo Giraudel. I probably only use like 4 out of those 7. My page isn’t super complex. I have some components that could probably go in pages, but I’m not unhappy with it. If I want to modify something, I know where it’s at right away. I use Post CSS with lost grid for my grid system. It allows me to just blitz through initial design and makes everything really flexible in terms of layout. I can’t think of much more to say on it other than take a look! </p>

        <p>In some of my projects, I mention how I manage the scope of it for one reason or another. Maybe little concessions I made that I’m not a fan of. I think back to this. It was perfect. It was a smooth well architected system. There was legitimate licensing concerns that could have been remedied, but ultimately I don’t think that's what killed it. </p>

        <p>We were paying Cisco guys to come in and train our staff for CCNA certifications, possibly CCNP as well. I had heard that we were going to buy some cisco gear specifically for our training room. Lets look at the down sides:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Physical hardware takes time to ship and install</li>
            <li>Takes up the already limited space in our training room</li>
            <li>Permanently renders a number of workstations unusable for Red Hat training classes</li>
            <li>It can only be used when a meeting/class/training session is not ongoing</li>
            <li>It can only be used in that room</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Real hardware can be valuable because that's what you have to use in the exam (at least it was like that few years ago). Dependent on how many abstraction layers you add though, this discrepancy can be overcome through logical conceptualization. </p>

        <p>Let’s look at simulation/emulation. You could use something like Cisco Packet Tracer (a simulator), but it doesn’t support the entirety of CLI commands and sometimes can hold your hand a little too much in terms of understanding the way concepts integrate with the world due to the heavier abstraction. </p>

        <p>The alternative is <a href='https://www.gns3.com/'>GNS3</a>. GNS3 is a Cisco device emulator. It uses real IOS images and you can build a network from them and even integrate external systems and devices. Albeit with severely decreased performance, but that's to be expected. There’s built in labs and exercises that could either surpass or supplement traditional materials. </p>

        <p>GNS3 is an application so now we need a central location to utilize the application that's ready for anyone to use, while at the same time persisting changes. Here’s the play. One server using Active Directory, and the other with Hyper-V serving desktops via a connection broker. It was slick. You want 30 new desktops with GNS3 preconfigured with IOS images and associated workshops?  One click (maybe it was 2, it’s been a while since I built this) and you spawn 30 desktops, they join the domain and are waiting in the deployment pool and are assigned automatically on a RDP connection. The desktops refresh on disconnect and the user files are saved to a share.  Now I don’t know if you’ve ever had to sysprep a windows system, but it’s a giant pain in the butt. There’s just weird stuff and poor documentation. For example something like auto joining the domain on a fresh desktop. You would think it’s in the last phase OOBE. Nope, WinPE phase (I think it was). So if you wanted to join the domain with a custom host name, you had to join with the auto hostname, add the host, unjoin, then rejoin. Of course this is a bug that’s been present since like server 2008. There was tons of little stuff like that. </p>

        <p>So I complete this crispy, clean, production grade system and shoot an email out to the associated parties. Nothing really happened. I almost caught flak for it. That’s not even the right word though. Some sort of attitude almost. They asked me about the system and then I never really heard anything more. Now this part is gossip, but I was talking to one of the Network guys and we we’re talking about the system I built. The then, I think it was COO at that point apparently just doesn’t like windows. I don’t know if that’s true. Knowing Liquid Web though I wouldn’t be surprised. More likely people just didn’t care, or didn’t have time to care. It was just frustrating because I spent a lot of time (most of it being my own) on that system. If someone was like “Ryan, we reached out to cisco and unfortunately they’re not willing to provide supplemental licensing for this system” I would be totally cool with that. I got nothing though. Just nothing. No one told me to not build things or do stuff, it just fizzled into the void that is Liquidweb.</p>

        <p>There was a team meeting and it was announced that we were going to release a Managed Wordpress platform.  I had my wordpress blog which I had managed to make really, really fast. In the process, I learned a thing or two about making a high performance wordpress server. Step 1, HHVM is a php handler that is easy mode fast. Problem is, it’s built to be new. With CentOS 6, the default gcc version is like 4.4 or something like that. I don’t even think 4.8 has perfect C++11 facilities, but I want to say that this is the version required to compile. Getting a separate gcc version and compiling against it is a nightmare. You just chase dependencies for days. I actually got it working. It wasn’t feasible though to distribute this hacked up compile for use. The other thing is that many of our customer have shared environments. With a more mature dameon like php-fpm you can for and provide user isolation. You can’t do that with HHVM. The developers also stated they currently have to intention to implement that. So now I want to provide user isolation to binary on a system with poor support. Enter in Docker. I’ll let you read about it, but I used ubuntu as the base and alpine linux as the supplement. I’m really happy with it because it embraces that core, one process per container ideology.  </p>

        <p>My long term objective is to build a hosting company. Currently, it’s just a logo and an idea. To do that though, I need two things. Customers, and a Hosting platform. It’s not feasible for me to build a datacenter, so I have to utilize companies that provide infrastructure with APIs. The objective is to use these asynchronous data concepts to link these platform with my customers. Use these hosts as infrastructure providers while I provide service as a product. Long term I can metastasis the market and use my position to whip saw providers and drive down my costs. </p>

        <p>Starting off, you can’t compete with me. Period. You can’t price me out of the market, you can’t do anything. If I have to build it on a shoestring, I can. I’d rather launch with some enterprise grade infrastructure. You’re talking 5-6 grand for the servers, and then whatever a colo case is going to cost me a month. By myself, I’m confident I can build a platform to scale for 1000 customers. One main server for reverse proxy, 2 app, 2 big memory for mysql and redis, and 2 for whmcs. I think a conservative estimate in profit per server I broker is ~20 dollars per month. The sweet spot is like a 4 gig server. I could pull like 40-60 a month on that. Here’s thing though. My market will be infinite. AWS done, Azure done, Digital Ocean Done, Rackspace Done. You can get a server anywhere, but people don’t goto Liquid Web for servers. They go there for service. I’m as good, if not better than any guy they got. I can fix anything. But the core will be packages engineered to operate at a grass roots level. Packages made for speed and security that inherently protect my IP. I was taking in 20+ tickets a day sometimes with back to back phone calls. I can do the same thing, but do it for me. I don’t have a decade of bloated management and just entrenched failure. </p>

        <p>We’re well beyond can I do it. Asynchronous data, check. Clean asset management and excellent site design, check. Phenomenal scope and understanding of the market, check. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not going to be absolutely perfect. I hate to say it, but it just has to work and be secure. Laravel handles all sorts of form validation, and just other inherent security. I’ll implement some good clean server setups with some security kernels to catch anything I could miss and call it a launch. If I get a job here, I’ll be able to slow down a bit and do it right. About a year out to launch and a nice easy customer acquisition run over another year. If not, I’ll probably have to get an unemployment extension, but I’ll go live within 2 or 3 months here, and blitz leads using the leads platform. </p>

            Good ol’ Linux Support. Where people talk about the job as if it were prison. “You’re new? Don’t worry man it will get better.”, “I’m getting out man. I’m going to another department!” “Nice! Congrats. How long you been in anyways?”
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m joking… but more of a sad joke… where it’s true… A lot of good experience came out of it at the rate of a firehose. But instead of water in the fire hose, it was more fire. We were a support role in a sense, but it wasn’t like I was resetting peoples modems. Things ranged from helping someone set up their email clients, to hacked sites, to custom software, to setting up databases. Really anything. The first year was really hard on me. Let me give you a concrete example of what I had to deal with. We had three supervisors for a shift, generally two at the same time. A queue super who managed tickets and a point super who managed techs and customers. There was a queue super in particular who was known for essentially just drowning people in tickets. He was often my queue super. There was a point super who would later be fired (shortly after an A+ review) for a myriad of reasons, but not limited to things like just not taking phone calls from customers or 2 hour lunches where he’d go drink. He was often my point super. These two supers would engage in multi hour meetings with various staff, often daily, under the auspices of “Team Meetings” of some sort or something like that. Now with a painting of my supervisorial staff, I’ll touch on what the work looked like. Guy calls in, 40 websites on a box, 10-20 of them are hacked with terrorist flags and some sort of music playing in the background, looks like a Geo Cities website. He’s panicked and angry of course. I get his information, and tell him I’ll open a ticket and look into his issue. Nope. He wants a supervisor immediately. My super would either try to tell me what I should say, or not be there, or be there and not take a call. This was not always, but it was often. So I tell the guy the super is busy and will call him back. Nope, he’ll wait. I can’t hang up on him. So now I have to fix these sites on the fly. Generally there were three scenarios. One, he has backups. Restore from backup, done. Two, there were no backups, but the hacks are only a few lines of code. Find and remove them in a one liner, done. Three, there were no backups, and the hacks blew out the site. Weep gently to yourself, done. Meanwhile I’m still getting more tickets. We joked that the queue super loved to wait until you were on the phone then give you a ticket. Another one of those sad type of jokes. We’ll say scenario one in this situation. Restore from backups. It’s good because it takes time for that to complete, and gives me time to respond to email spam ticket I was just handed. I get a message from another admin. That ticket I just responded to is on the phone and wants to talk to me. Of course, I’m still on the phone with hacked guy. “Tell them I’ll call them back” I say. Backup restore is still going. I fix the spam issue and ask the customer if they still need a call. Luckily, they say that's ok. Restore is done now and I tell the customer that's still with me on the phone. He’s calmed down and says he’ll be waiting on that supervisor call. Thank’s me for my time and then hangs up. This whole exchange took 20-40 minutes. I breath for just a moment. Note the account for the call, and my phone rings again as I’m noting the ticket. I still have other tickets to attend to. This will be the cycle for every second of my day for at least a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now mind you in all of this, there isn’t really any help. There were the heavily overloaded “mentors” who would often just link (sometimes incorrect) articles from google, and “escalators” who would just make fun of you and maybe feel bad enough to help you sometimes. Ideally something like the hacked sites guy would have gone to sec team. But no one on sec team is going to take that call if they don’t have to, and I don’t have real supervisors. In fact, if they were in the meeting room, I didn’t have any supervisors! Year two wasn’t without its own issues, but it was better. It spawned some wonderful life experiences, and good friends. So that was cool at least.

            People must not have realized what setups was when the posting went out. Two people applied, so I had like a 10% chance at it. I like those odds. I’m joking, the other applicant had a write up, I actually had a 15% chance. All joking aside it was pretty great for a while. You finally get out of support and realize the mushroom managment with that department. It feels a bit like that moment near the end of Shawshank Redemption where Andy Dufresne is standing in the rain. You finally get to see the company, the real company. Not the daily slosh that is support. You talk to your old colleagues, “How are things?” “We just got hit with xyz exploit, plus dev team pushed an update at 5pm on a friday alongside that product launch with no information and we can’t get a hold of anyone”. While I am truly concerned (I mean it) with the well being of my co-workers, I have to breathe a sigh of relief. I don’t have to feel that absolute dread of waking up and going into my job.

            The core role was building servers, racking them, and initializing the system. What does that entail? Really any where, any one needed a server in the company, we built them. A build order would come in and you would review it for errors, sometimes clarify choices and make recommendations to modify them. That ranges from a single server to many servers. All types of drives, raid cards, network cards, motherboards, processors. Sometimes firewalls and switches. Really anything you could want. A server made to order.

            I also got to manage our Windows Deployment System. It seems simple enough, but I added a Hyper-V server to the setup and it made updating images a lot faster. We used to build a box, install windows, update it, then push it to the deployment workbench. Using Hyper-V, I could have a system with snap shots ready for just one round of updates, push it live and then it would still be ready for the next run.

            There were weeks where there was legitimately only 5 hours worth of work to do. You’d come in and your boss would be like “I’m hungry, steaks?” and the team would go get steaks from kroger and we would grill them. Don’t get me wrong, this was not weekly. It takes 20 minutes to go to kroger and back. 10-15 to grill and 15-20 to eat. I don’t know what it’s like at other companies, but to go from eating a chicken patty with no bun and some ketchup at your desk while you grind tickets to actually having a real lunch, it was amazing. It wasn’t always that slow, and at times lunch was relegated to a protein shake at the workbench because there was not even time to sit down. You’d just be on your feet for 8+ hours building servers. But there was reprieve in this role and it was much welcomed.

            Setups was great for a while, but it was killing me softly. I’m very active. I want to do things, make things, be productive. I want to have purpose. Setups was the facebook browsers dream. If you wanted to do nothing, you could, and some people did. I’m not saying I never took a down day, but I kept very busy. It was a bit hard on me though because we’d have a slow week and I’d spin up a project in one form or another. I’d be enjoying my self and then work would get busy. Sometimes work was cool, I’d get to build something with Fusion IO drives or some cool setup like that. Mostly though it was tedious, and there was a lot to do. There’s a mental toll too, to having your work being invalidated. Very often, we had to build the same set up multiple times. Usually do to a bad order, something that was syntactically correct so we couldn’t catch it. When you put 6 hours in on a build to hear it had to be redone, it makes hard to enjoy your work. A paycheck is nice, but I like fufillment (but a paycheck is nice). Overall though, it wasn’t a terrible gig.

            In the past I had worked with Django to create some rudimentary applications, done plenty of advanced bash scripting in various contexts. I’ve read and done ~300 pages worth of the C++ primer 5th ed (twice). I worked with an Arduino to get a sensor to read electrical signals based on muscle movement. So I’ve always flirted with development concepts as I worked with all of the systems surrounding an application. I’d never really built a fully fledged application though. Since my departure from Liquid Web, I have been working somewhere around 12-16 hours a day 6-7 days a week boot camping a development skill set that is beyond rudimentary. I took some tests related to development for a recruiter I’m working with.

            So three months ago, if you asked “Ryan, can you create a comprehensive framework that focuses on the concepts of a modern web?” I would have had to say no. Looking forward though, the idea of “can” is starting to look a lot more infinite. My skill set has skyrocketed in the last few months. Don’t get me wrong, there are still plenty of nuances in all of the platforms I’ve learned in three months that I still don’t know. But we’re well beyond rudimentary, and well beyond copy-paste coding (...mostly). In the span of three months I’ve learned PHP, JS, CSS, and HTML. Alongside this, any number of intermediate platforms and systems. Git, PhpStorm, Laravel, Gulp, Bower, transpilers(JSX/Babel), CSS compilers (sass, less, stylus), CSS post processors (PostCSS), grids like Lost Grid. Architectural assets like Supervisord, Beanstalkd, Redis. The work of which is readily displayed here. I’ll be talking about design choices, and where my work is headed in the projects “Lead Tracker”, “HireRyan.Today”, and “BinaryOasis.com”
